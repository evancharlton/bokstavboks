# Bokstavboks

Bokstavboks is a Norwegian word game. The objective is to use all 12 letters
with as few words as possible.

It is heavily inspired by [NYTimes Letter Boxed][letterboxed]. However, as it
is an educational tool, the user can play (and replay) as many games as they
wish.

It is free to play on <https://evancharlton.github.io/bokstavboks>.
